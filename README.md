# c1 SEO Accessibiilty Standards

## Description

This a website for the Horiseon corportion which has been edited to include Semantic HTML Elements in a logical structure, accesible alt attributes, sequential headings, and a title element. This has been done to make the Horiseon website more accessible and make the code easier to navigate. Throughout this project I used VScode to add the necessary elements, attributes, and headings necessary. Furthermore, I also used the VScode program to reduce redundancy. 

Now the Horiseon website will be easier to navigate when looking at the code, the website will be up-to-date to accessibility standards, and code has been updated so all aspects of the website are working. By doing this the Horiseon is now easier to use and read for both developers and non-developers and accesibile for those who need it. Throughout this process I learned how to affect multiple tags at the same time to speed up work, what "clean code" looks like, and how to give accessiblity attributes to CSS images.
